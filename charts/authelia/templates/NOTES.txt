Thank you for installing the {{ include "authelia.chart" . }} Chart.

Please report any issues at https://github.com/authelia/chartrepo.

The helm release name is {{ .Release.Name }}.

{{- if (include "authelia.enabled.ingress.standard" .) }}
You have selected to use a regular ingress.

You should be able to access Authelia soon via https://{{ include "authelia.ingressHostWithPath" . }} if everything is configured correctly in your values and the DNS record points to the correct location.

You will also need to direct your ingress to use the following path for forward auth: {{ include "authelia.forwardAuthPath" (merge (dict "Namespace" .Release.Namespace) .) }}.

The following are the suggested annotations for 'ingress-nginx':
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: http://{{ include "authelia.name" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local/api/verify
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://{{ include "authelia.ingressHostWithPath" . }}
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers: Remote-User,Remote-Name,Remote-Groups,Remote-Email
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-snippet: |
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Method $request_method;
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Method $request_method;

{{- else if (include "authelia.enabled.ingress.traefik" .) }}
You have selected the Traefik CRD to deploy the ingress. You can apply the {{ include "authelia.ingress.traefikCRD.middleware.name.chainAuth" . }} ({{ .Release.Namespace }} namespace) middleware to any Traefik ingress type in order to use Authelia auth with that ingress.

You should be able to access Authelia soon via https://{{ include "authelia.ingressHostWithPath" . }} if everything is configured correctly in your values and the DNS record points to the correct location.
{{- else -}}
You have not installed an ingress which you can do manually by specifying {{ include "authelia.name" . }} as the service and {{ include "authelia.service.port" . }} as the port.
{{- end -}}

You can also direct your ingress to use the following path for forward auth: {{ include "authelia.forwardAuthPath" (merge (dict "Namespace" .Release.Namespace) .) }}.
