## ⚠️ Development Status

**This chart repository is in extremely early development (pre-1.0).** We use 0.major.minor semantic versioning, which means:
- **No stability guarantees** - Breaking changes may occur in any release
- **API may change without notice** - Chart structure and values can change significantly
- **Not recommended for production use** - Use at your own risk
- **Always pin to specific versions** - Avoid version ranges to prevent unexpected breaking changes during updates

---

This repository is for hosting Authelia specific helm charts. Currently we only host a single chart which is still in
development.

## Getting Started
